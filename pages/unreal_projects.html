          This video is a prototype I did for a horror/survival game
          some classmates and I had an idea for. They dropped out of the 
          project soon after the prototype was made, but the work is still there. 
          I used Unreal Engine 4.16, and all of the programming for the camera 
          and player controller is in C++. I used Unreal's Blueprint system for the 
          audio, trigger points (where birds make sounds), and the day/night system.

          Torch is a game jam game. Although it's unfinished, since time ran out, the premise of it was that you are a mage in training. This is your initiation mission, and there are three puzzles that you must figure out to pass.<br />
          - Trial 1: Find the ancient relic of the mages using your trained magic sight to figure out the order of the ancient symbols, and place their stones on the proper pedestal.<br />
          - Trial 2: Decifer the ancient language of the elders to find the path to the final chamber door.<br />
          - Trial 3: Follow the path of the elders who first learned of magic to understand why the mages are who they are to this day.

          I drew this little guy in Adobe Illustrator. He is a 2D character that lives in 3D world. A co-worker started to draw Odie from "Garfield and Friends" on a white board, and I didn't see it. I saw what I now call Ravvit. Like I said, he was drawn in Illustrator, then I exported the layers into a 2D animation program called Spriter to make the animations, and finally used Unreal Engine and it's Paper2D and Flipbook systems to put him into the 3D starter level. He was basically a proof of concept that this could be done, and what it would take to do it.
