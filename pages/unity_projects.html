          This was a one day game jam game that myself and another programmer put together for.
          My contributions were the character controller, enemy AI, damage to enemies, platform AI, cannon functionality,
          checkpoint functionality, UI, win/loss state, character damage, camera controller, player animation controller,
          player health reset on "play again" menu choice, and audio programming.<br /><br />
          I also did the level design and object placement. I have gotten permission from the other programmer to continue
          to develop this game, so it's still in slow progress as a lone project. It's best played with an XBox One controller
          and if you'd like to play it you can download and install from here:<br />

          Clean Your Room is a converted project that I started in Unreal Engine 4. I made the decision to convert it over because it seemed
          like more of a Unity project than it was suited for Unreal. It's target audiance is kids ages 3 - 11, but it's also fun to play for
          adults! I mean, who doesn't like a good explosion and gold stars?!? This is a pet project of mine because it's mainly being developed
          for my 6 (almost 7) year old daughter, and she's enjoyed testing for me its entire lifetime of development. It can be played as both
          a mouse/keyboard game or Xbox One controller game. I created a system that auto detects if you have an Xbox controller connected. If
          it detects one it defaults to the controller, whereas if it doesn't detect an Xbox controller its controls are mouse/keyboard.<br /><br />
          I used Kenny Assets for the character and props in the room. Other interesting features this game has are as follows:<br />
          - Camera system that detects if the  player is close enough to a wall the wall becomes transparent so the player can still be seen.<br />
          - Pickup inheritance: Both types of pickups come from a base pickup script that is then extended by any other pickup objects that have special features.<br/>
          - Exploding Pickups: The exploding pickups spawn more base pickups that are then added into the achievement system as to how many pickups need to be collected
          before getting the next achievement.<br />
          - Achievement System: This is created to populate the star UI as the player collects more pickups, it's recalculated when the user hits an
          exploding pickup. However, if an achievement is earned it isn't taken away just because an exploding pickup was hit.<br />
